# Workers

Cloudflare workers âš¡

## Installation

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is used for deps, tests, and scripts; [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler) is for development and deployment.

```sh
# install bun
export PATH="${HOME}/.bun/bin:${PATH}"
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# install dependencies
bun i

# configure environment (only if you want to deploy)
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
```

## Usage

### Environment variables

Each worker depends on a `.dev.vars` in its directory. These set secrets on the `env` object during development. For example, the `huggingface` worker would require this in `huggingface/.dev.vars`:

```
HF_TOKEN=hf_...
```

See [`types.ts`](./lib/types.ts) for more. Use `wrangler secret {list,put,delete} --name=...` to manage secrets for a deployed worker (or use the [dash](https://dash.cloudflare.com)).

### Scripts

Each worker gets its own `start` and `deploy` script:

```sh
# run the huggingface worker locally
bun start:hf

# deploy the huggingface worker to hf.you.workers.dev
bun deploy:hf
```
